### Lesson 1
- Grade: 7
- Subject: Home Language
- Term: 1
- Topic: Literature
- Lesson Title: Identifying Theme in a Short Story
- Lesson Content:
  A theme is the big idea or message in a story. It tells what the story teaches about life or people.

  To find the theme, look at how the characters change and what problems they face. The theme is not one event but a general message.

  Common themes include courage, friendship, and responsibility.
- Key Concepts:
  - Theme
  - Character change
  - Message
- Worked Example:
  A story about a learner who tells the truth even when it is hard may have the theme of honesty.
- Quick Check:
  - What is the difference between a theme and a plot?
  - Give one possible theme for a story about teamwork.
- Summary:
  The theme is the story’s main message about life.

### Lesson 2
- Grade: 7
- Subject: First Additional Language
- Term: 1
- Topic: Grammar
- Lesson Title: Direct and Indirect Speech
- Lesson Content:
  Direct speech repeats the exact words spoken and uses quotation marks. Indirect speech reports what was said without quotation marks.

  When changing to indirect speech, the tense often shifts back, and pronouns may change to match the speaker.

  This helps you report conversations clearly in writing.
- Key Concepts:
  - Direct speech
  - Indirect speech
  - Tense shift
- Worked Example:
  Direct: “I am ready,” said Musa.
  Indirect: Musa said that he was ready.
- Quick Check:
  - Change to indirect speech: “We are late,” said Ana.
  - What punctuation shows direct speech?
- Summary:
  Direct speech uses exact words; indirect speech reports them with tense changes.

### Lesson 3
- Grade: 7
- Subject: Mathematics
- Term: 1
- Topic: Integers
- Lesson Title: Adding and Subtracting Integers
- Lesson Content:
  Integers include positive and negative numbers. The number line helps show their order and distance from zero.

  When adding integers with different signs, subtract their absolute values and keep the sign of the larger absolute value.

  Subtracting an integer is the same as adding its opposite.
- Key Concepts:
  - Integers
  - Absolute value
  - Opposite numbers
- Worked Example:
  Calculate: -7 + 3
  1) Absolute values: 7 and 3.
  2) Subtract: 7 − 3 = 4.
  3) Keep the sign of -7: Answer = -4.
- Quick Check:
  - Calculate: 5 + (-8)
  - Calculate: -6 − (-2)
- Summary:
  Use absolute values and signs to add and subtract integers correctly.

### Lesson 4
- Grade: 7
- Subject: Natural Sciences
- Term: 1
- Topic: Force and Motion
- Lesson Title: Speed and the Speed Formula
- Lesson Content:
  Speed tells how fast an object moves. It depends on the distance traveled and the time taken.

  The formula for speed is $\text{speed} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}$. Distance is measured in metres or kilometres, and time in seconds or hours.

  Accurate measurement of distance and time allows you to calculate speed in scientific investigations.
- Key Concepts:
  - Speed
  - Distance
  - Time
- Worked Example:
  A runner covers 200 m in 40 s.
  1) Use $v = d/t$.
  2) $v = 200/40 = 5$ m/s.
  3) The speed is 5 m/s.
- Quick Check:
  - A cyclist travels 15 km in 0.5 h. What is the speed?
  - If speed is 3 m/s for 10 s, how far is traveled?
- Summary:
  Speed is distance divided by time and is measured with a clear formula.

### Lesson 5
- Grade: 7
- Subject: Social Sciences
- Term: 1
- Topic: Geography Skills
- Lesson Title: Scale on Maps
- Lesson Content:
  A map scale shows the relationship between map distance and real distance. It can be written as a ratio or shown with a line scale.

  You can use a ruler to measure a map distance and then convert it using the scale.

  Scale helps you estimate real-world distances accurately.
- Key Concepts:
  - Map scale
  - Ratio
  - Distance conversion
- Worked Example:
  Scale 1:50 000 means 1 cm on the map = 50 000 cm in reality = 500 m.
- Quick Check:
  - What real distance is 2 cm at a scale of 1:100 000?
  - Why is scale important?
- Summary:
  Map scale converts map measurements into real distances.

### Lesson 6
- Grade: 7
- Subject: Technology
- Term: 1
- Topic: Structures
- Lesson Title: Frames and Bracing
- Lesson Content:
  A frame structure is made of beams joined together. It is strong when the shape is stable, like a triangle.

  Bracing adds extra supports to stop the structure from bending or collapsing. Triangular bracing is very effective.

  Engineers use frames and bracing in bridges, towers, and roofs.
- Key Concepts:
  - Frame structure
  - Bracing
  - Stability
- Worked Example:
  A square frame becomes stronger when a diagonal brace is added, forming two triangles.
- Quick Check:
  - Why are triangles strong shapes?
  - What is bracing used for?
- Summary:
  Frames become stable when bracing creates strong triangular shapes.

### Lesson 7
- Grade: 7
- Subject: Economic and Management Sciences
- Term: 1
- Topic: Money and Budgeting
- Lesson Title: Creating a Simple Budget
- Lesson Content:
  A budget is a plan for how money will be earned and spent. It helps you control expenses and save for goals.

  List all sources of income and all expenses. Then compare totals to see if there is a surplus or shortage.

  Budgeting develops responsible financial habits.
- Key Concepts:
  - Income
  - Expenses
  - Surplus and deficit
- Worked Example:
  Income: R200. Expenses: R120. Surplus: R80.
- Quick Check:
  - What is the difference between income and expenses?
  - If expenses are higher than income, what is this called?
- Summary:
  A budget compares income and expenses to guide spending.

### Lesson 8
- Grade: 7
- Subject: Life Orientation
- Term: 1
- Topic: Rights and Responsibilities
- Lesson Title: Respecting Human Rights
- Lesson Content:
  Human rights are basic freedoms that protect all people. These include the right to education, safety, and dignity.

  Responsibilities are the actions you take to respect other people’s rights. For example, respecting school rules helps everyone learn.

  Rights and responsibilities work together to create a fair society.
- Key Concepts:
  - Human rights
  - Responsibilities
  - Respect
- Worked Example:
  The right to education is supported when learners attend regularly and treat others with respect.
- Quick Check:
  - Name one human right.
  - Why do responsibilities matter?
- Summary:
  Rights protect people, and responsibilities help keep those rights safe.

### Lesson 9
- Grade: 7
- Subject: Creative Arts
- Term: 1
- Topic: Visual Arts
- Lesson Title: Elements of Art: Line and Shape
- Lesson Content:
  Lines can be straight, curved, thick, or thin. They guide the viewer’s eye and create movement.

  Shapes are formed when lines meet. Shapes can be geometric like squares or organic like leaves.

  Artists use line and shape to build images and patterns.
- Key Concepts:
  - Line
  - Shape
  - Geometric and organic
- Worked Example:
  A simple house drawing uses straight lines and rectangles for walls and a triangle for the roof.
- Quick Check:
  - Name two types of lines.
  - What is the difference between geometric and organic shapes?
- Summary:
  Line and shape are basic elements used to create artworks.
