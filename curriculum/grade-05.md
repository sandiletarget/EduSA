### Lesson 1
- Grade: 5
- Subject: Home Language
- Term: 1
- Topic: Narrative Writing
- Lesson Title: Planning a Short Story
- Lesson Content:
  A narrative is a story with characters, a setting, and a plot. A clear plot has a beginning, middle, and end.

  Planning helps you write a strong story. You decide who the characters are, where the story happens, and what problem needs to be solved.

  Using a story map helps you organise ideas before you write full paragraphs.
- Key Concepts:
  - Characters
  - Setting
  - Plot structure
- Worked Example:
  Story map: Character—Thandi; Setting—village; Problem—lost goat; Solution—finds it near the river.
- Quick Check:
  - What are three parts of a plot?
  - Why is planning useful for writing?
- Summary:
  Narrative planning uses characters, setting, and plot to build a clear story.

### Lesson 2
- Grade: 5
- Subject: First Additional Language
- Term: 1
- Topic: Grammar
- Lesson Title: Using Adjectives in Sentences
- Lesson Content:
  Adjectives describe nouns. They help readers picture things clearly by adding details about size, colour, or feeling.

  You can place adjectives before the noun, such as “bright star,” or after a linking verb, such as “The star is bright.”

  Using precise adjectives improves speaking and writing.
- Key Concepts:
  - Adjectives
  - Nouns
  - Descriptive language
- Worked Example:
  The sentence “The river is wide and calm” uses adjectives “wide” and “calm.”
- Quick Check:
  - Underline the adjective: “The small dog barked loudly.”
  - Add two adjectives to the noun “house.”
- Summary:
  Adjectives add detail and help nouns become more specific.

### Lesson 3
- Grade: 5
- Subject: Mathematics
- Term: 1
- Topic: Fractions
- Lesson Title: Equivalent Fractions
- Lesson Content:
  Equivalent fractions are different fractions that have the same value. You can make them by multiplying or dividing the numerator and denominator by the same number.

  This is useful when comparing fractions or simplifying them. Always change both parts of the fraction by the same factor.

  Understanding equivalence helps with addition and subtraction of fractions.
- Key Concepts:
  - Numerator and denominator
  - Equivalent fractions
  - Simplifying
- Worked Example:
  Show that 2/3 = 4/6.
  1) Multiply numerator and denominator by 2.
  2) 2×2 = 4 and 3×2 = 6.
  3) So 2/3 = 4/6.
- Quick Check:
  - Write a fraction equivalent to 3/5.
  - Simplify 6/8.
- Summary:
  Equivalent fractions are made by multiplying or dividing both parts by the same number.

### Lesson 4
- Grade: 5
- Subject: Natural Sciences and Technology
- Term: 1
- Topic: Matter and Materials
- Lesson Title: Solids, Liquids, and Gases
- Lesson Content:
  Matter exists as solids, liquids, and gases. Solids keep their shape, liquids take the shape of their container, and gases spread out to fill space.

  Heating and cooling can change the state of matter. Melting changes a solid to a liquid, and evaporation changes a liquid to a gas.

  These changes are physical because the substance stays the same.
- Key Concepts:
  - States of matter
  - Melting and evaporation
  - Physical change
- Worked Example:
  Ice melts into water when heated. The substance is still water.
- Quick Check:
  - What state of matter fills all available space?
  - Name one change of state.
- Summary:
  Solids, liquids, and gases have different properties, and heating or cooling can change states.

### Lesson 5
- Grade: 5
- Subject: Social Sciences
- Term: 1
- Topic: South African Provinces
- Lesson Title: Provinces and Capitals
- Lesson Content:
  South Africa has nine provinces. Each province has a capital city that serves as its administrative centre.

  Knowing provinces and capitals helps you read maps and understand where places are located.

  You can use a map to locate each province and learn its capital city.
- Key Concepts:
  - Provinces
  - Capital cities
  - Map location
- Worked Example:
  Gauteng is a province and its capital city is Johannesburg.
- Quick Check:
  - How many provinces are there in South Africa?
  - Name the capital city of KwaZulu-Natal.
- Summary:
  Provinces are regions with capital cities that you can locate on a map.

### Lesson 6
- Grade: 5
- Subject: Life Skills
- Term: 1
- Topic: Physical Education
- Lesson Title: Fitness Components
- Lesson Content:
  Fitness has different components such as strength, endurance, flexibility, and balance. Each component can be improved through practice.

  Strength helps you lift or push, while endurance helps you keep moving for a long time. Flexibility helps your joints move easily.

  Balanced activities keep the body healthy and reduce injury.
- Key Concepts:
  - Strength
  - Endurance
  - Flexibility
- Worked Example:
  Jogging builds endurance, while stretching improves flexibility.
- Quick Check:
  - Which activity helps endurance?
  - Why is flexibility important?
- Summary:
  Fitness includes strength, endurance, and flexibility, and each can be trained.
