### Lesson 1
- Grade: 12
- Subject: Home Language
- Term: 1
- Topic: Literature
- Lesson Title: Analysing a Setwork Essay Question
- Lesson Content:
  Setwork essays require a focused response to a specific question. You must interpret the question and build an argument that answers it directly.

  Key steps include identifying keywords, planning points, and selecting relevant evidence from the text.

  A clear structure with introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion improves coherence and marks.
- Key Concepts:
  - Keyword analysis
  - Evidence selection
  - Structured argument
- Worked Example:
  If the question asks about “conflict,” plan paragraphs around different conflicts and support each with quotations.
- Quick Check:
  - What should you do first when reading an essay question?
  - Why must evidence be relevant?
- Summary:
  Setwork essays require careful question analysis and focused evidence.

### Lesson 2
- Grade: 12
- Subject: First Additional Language
- Term: 1
- Topic: Transactional Writing
- Lesson Title: Writing a CV
- Lesson Content:
  A CV summarises your education, skills, and experience. It should be clear, accurate, and well organised.

  Use headings such as Personal Details, Education, Skills, and References. Keep language formal and concise.

  A good CV highlights strengths and is easy to scan quickly.
- Key Concepts:
  - Concise writing
  - Headings
  - Professional tone
- Worked Example:
  Under “Skills,” list items like “Computer literacy” or “Teamwork.”
- Quick Check:
  - What is the purpose of a CV?
  - Name two useful CV headings.
- Summary:
  A CV presents your qualifications clearly and professionally.

### Lesson 3
- Grade: 12
- Subject: Mathematics
- Term: 1
- Topic: Differential Calculus
- Lesson Title: Finding the Gradient with Derivatives
- Lesson Content:
  The derivative gives the gradient of a curve at any point. For a function $f(x)$, the derivative is $f'(x)$.

  Basic rules include $\frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = nx^{n-1}$ and $\frac{d}{dx}(c) = 0$ for constants.

  Derivatives are used to find rates of change and turning points.
- Key Concepts:
  - Derivative
  - Gradient
  - Rate of change
- Worked Example:
  If $f(x) = x^3 - 4x$:
  1) $f'(x) = 3x^2 - 4$.
  2) The gradient at $x=2$ is $3(4) - 4 = 8$.
- Quick Check:
  - Differentiate $f(x) = 5x^2 + 2x$.
  - What does the derivative represent on a graph?
- Summary:
  Derivatives give gradients and rates of change using standard rules.

### Lesson 4
- Grade: 12
- Subject: Life Orientation
- Term: 1
- Topic: Stress Management
- Lesson Title: Managing Exam Stress
- Lesson Content:
  Stress is a normal response to pressure, but too much stress can affect performance. Recognising symptoms helps you respond early.

  Effective strategies include time management, regular breaks, exercise, and healthy sleep.

  Balanced routines support focus and emotional well-being.
- Key Concepts:
  - Stress symptoms
  - Coping strategies
  - Balance
- Worked Example:
  A study plan that includes short breaks every hour helps reduce mental fatigue.
- Quick Check:
  - Name one physical sign of stress.
  - Why are breaks useful when studying?
- Summary:
  Managing stress requires planning, healthy habits, and balance.

### Lesson 5
- Grade: 12
- Subject: Physical Sciences
- Term: 1
- Topic: Electricity
- Lesson Title: Electric Power and Energy
- Lesson Content:
  Electric power is the rate at which electrical energy is transferred. The formula is $P = VI$.

  Power can also be written as $P = I^2R$ or $P = \frac{V^2}{R}$. Energy used is $E = Pt$.

  These formulas help calculate electricity usage and costs.
- Key Concepts:
  - Power
  - Energy
  - Electrical circuits
- Worked Example:
  A device uses $V=12$ V and $I=2$ A.
  1) $P = VI = 12 \times 2 = 24$ W.
- Quick Check:
  - Calculate $P$ when $V=230$ V and $I=0.5$ A.
  - What does $E = Pt$ represent?
- Summary:
  Electric power and energy are calculated using $P = VI$ and $E = Pt$.

### Lesson 6
- Grade: 12
- Subject: Life Sciences
- Term: 1
- Topic: Genetics and Molecular Biology
- Lesson Title: DNA and Protein Synthesis
- Lesson Content:
  DNA stores genetic information in sequences of bases. Genes provide instructions for making proteins.

  During transcription, mRNA is formed from a DNA template. During translation, ribosomes use mRNA to build a protein using amino acids.

  This process controls cell structure and function and explains inheritance at a molecular level.
- Key Concepts:
  - DNA
  - Transcription
  - Translation
- Worked Example:
  A DNA triplet ATG is transcribed to mRNA UAC, which codes for a specific amino acid.
- Quick Check:
  - What is the role of mRNA?
  - Name the two main stages of protein synthesis.
- Summary:
  Protein synthesis uses transcription and translation to build proteins from DNA instructions.
