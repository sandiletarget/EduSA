### Lesson 1
- Grade: 10
- Subject: Home Language
- Term: 1
- Topic: Essay Writing
- Lesson Title: Planning a Discursive Essay
- Lesson Content:
  A discursive essay explores different sides of a topic before reaching a conclusion. It is balanced, formal, and uses evidence.

  Start by brainstorming arguments for and against the topic. Group similar ideas and plan paragraphs with clear points.

  A strong introduction explains the topic, and the conclusion summarises the main points without adding new information.
- Key Concepts:
  - Discursive essay
  - Balanced arguments
  - Formal style
- Worked Example:
  Topic: “Social media does more harm than good.” Plan one paragraph for benefits and one for risks before concluding.
- Quick Check:
  - What makes a discursive essay balanced?
  - What should a conclusion avoid?
- Summary:
  Discursive essays present multiple viewpoints using formal, structured writing.

### Lesson 2
- Grade: 10
- Subject: First Additional Language
- Term: 1
- Topic: Transactional Writing
- Lesson Title: Writing a Formal Letter
- Lesson Content:
  A formal letter follows a standard layout with addresses, date, subject line, and formal greeting. The language must be polite and clear.

  The body should be organised into short paragraphs that explain the purpose. The ending includes a formal closing and signature.

  Formal letters are used for applications, complaints, or requests.
- Key Concepts:
  - Formal tone
  - Structure
  - Purpose
- Worked Example:
  A letter requesting information includes a clear subject line and polite request in the first paragraph.
- Quick Check:
  - What is the purpose of a subject line?
  - Name one formal closing.
- Summary:
  Formal letters use a structured layout and polite, clear language.

### Lesson 3
- Grade: 10
- Subject: Mathematics
- Term: 1
- Topic: Functions
- Lesson Title: Understanding Linear Functions
- Lesson Content:
  A linear function has the form $y = mx + c$, where $m$ is the gradient and $c$ is the $y$-intercept.

  The gradient shows the rate of change: positive $m$ rises, negative $m$ falls. The intercept shows where the graph crosses the $y$-axis.

  Linear functions model relationships such as constant speed or steady growth.
- Key Concepts:
  - Gradient
  - $y$-intercept
  - Rate of change
- Worked Example:
  For $y = 2x + 3$:
  1) Gradient $m = 2$.
  2) $y$-intercept $c = 3$.
  3) Point where $x=0$ is $(0,3)$.
- Quick Check:
  - Identify $m$ and $c$ in $y = -4x + 1$.
  - What does a negative gradient mean?
- Summary:
  Linear functions use $y = mx + c$ to show constant rates of change.

### Lesson 4
- Grade: 10
- Subject: Life Orientation
- Term: 1
- Topic: Study Skills
- Lesson Title: Managing Time for Academic Success
- Lesson Content:
  Effective study uses regular planning. A weekly timetable helps balance study time, rest, and other responsibilities.

  Breaking tasks into smaller steps reduces stress and improves focus. Setting priorities ensures the most important work is done first.

  Consistent habits lead to better performance and confidence.
- Key Concepts:
  - Timetable
  - Priorities
  - Consistency
- Worked Example:
  A learner schedules 45 minutes of Mathematics each weekday and reviews notes on Saturday.
- Quick Check:
  - Why is a timetable useful?
  - What does it mean to prioritise tasks?
- Summary:
  Planning, prioritising, and consistent routines improve study effectiveness.

### Lesson 5
- Grade: 10
- Subject: Physical Sciences
- Term: 1
- Topic: Kinematics
- Lesson Title: Using the Constant Acceleration Equations
- Lesson Content:
  Motion with constant acceleration is described using equations that link displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time.

  The key equations include $v = u + at$ and $s = ut + \tfrac{1}{2}at^2$.

  These formulas help solve problems about objects speeding up or slowing down in a straight line.
- Key Concepts:
  - Acceleration
  - Velocity
  - Displacement
- Worked Example:
  A car starts from rest ($u=0$) and accelerates at $2\,m/s^2$ for $5\,s$.
  1) Use $v = u + at$.
  2) $v = 0 + 2(5) = 10\,m/s$.
- Quick Check:
  - Calculate $v$ if $u=3\,m/s$, $a=2\,m/s^2$, $t=4\,s$.
  - What does constant acceleration mean?
- Summary:
  Constant acceleration uses standard equations to relate $u$, $v$, $a$, $t$, and $s$.

### Lesson 6
- Grade: 10
- Subject: Life Sciences
- Term: 1
- Topic: Cells
- Lesson Title: Structure and Function of Cells
- Lesson Content:
  Cells are the basic units of life. Animal and plant cells share structures such as the nucleus, cytoplasm, and cell membrane.

  Plant cells also have a cell wall, chloroplasts, and a large central vacuole. Each organelle performs a specific function.

  Understanding cell structure helps explain how organisms grow, reproduce, and maintain life processes.
- Key Concepts:
  - Organelle
  - Nucleus
  - Cell membrane
- Worked Example:
  Chloroplasts contain chlorophyll, which is needed for photosynthesis in plant cells.
- Quick Check:
  - Name two organelles found in both plant and animal cells.
  - What is the function of the nucleus?
- Summary:
  Cell structures work together to keep organisms alive and functioning.
