### Lesson 1
- Grade: 4
- Subject: Home Language
- Term: 1
- Topic: Reading Comprehension
- Lesson Title: Finding Main Ideas and Details
- Lesson Content:
  Reading for meaning starts with the main idea. The main idea is the most important message in a paragraph or story. It is usually supported by several details.

  Details are facts, examples, or explanations that tell more about the main idea. Good readers look for words that repeat or point to the same topic.

  When you can identify the main idea and details, you understand the text better and can explain it in your own words.
- Key Concepts:
  - Main idea
  - Supporting details
  - Topic words
- Worked Example:
  A paragraph says: “Cats are popular pets. They are clean, playful, and can live in small spaces.” The main idea is “Cats are popular pets.” The details are “clean,” “playful,” and “live in small spaces.”
- Quick Check:
  - What is the main idea of a paragraph?
  - Name two things that support a main idea.
- Summary:
  The main idea is the key message, and details explain or prove it.

### Lesson 2
- Grade: 4
- Subject: First Additional Language
- Term: 1
- Topic: Vocabulary and Word Families
- Lesson Title: Building Words with Common Roots
- Lesson Content:
  Word families help you learn many words at once. A root word is the base word that carries meaning. Prefixes and suffixes change the meaning or the tense.

  For example, the root “play” can become “player,” “played,” or “playful.” Learning word families helps you read and spell new words.

  Practice by grouping words with the same root and noticing how the meaning changes.
- Key Concepts:
  - Root words
  - Prefixes
  - Suffixes
- Worked Example:
  Root: “help.” Word family: help, helper, helpful, helpless, helped.
- Quick Check:
  - What is a root word?
  - Make two new words from “jump.”
- Summary:
  Word families grow vocabulary by using prefixes and suffixes around a root.

### Lesson 3
- Grade: 4
- Subject: Mathematics
- Term: 1
- Topic: Place Value and Rounding
- Lesson Title: Rounding Numbers to the Nearest Ten
- Lesson Content:
  Place value tells you the value of each digit. In 3 482, the 4 is in the hundreds place, so it means 400.

  Rounding to the nearest ten helps estimate quickly. Look at the ones digit. If it is 0–4, round down; if it is 5–9, round up.

  Rounding keeps numbers easy to use while staying close to the exact value.
- Key Concepts:
  - Place value
  - Rounding rule
  - Estimation
- Worked Example:
  Round 3 482 to the nearest ten.
  1) The ones digit is 2.
  2) 2 is less than 5, so round down.
  3) Answer: 3 480.
- Quick Check:
  - Round 6 735 to the nearest ten.
  - What is the hundreds value in 5 241?
- Summary:
  Place value shows digit values, and rounding uses the ones digit to estimate to tens.

### Lesson 4
- Grade: 4
- Subject: Natural Sciences and Technology
- Term: 1
- Topic: Living and Non-living Things
- Lesson Title: What Makes Something Living?
- Lesson Content:
  Living things have life processes such as movement, growth, reproduction, and response to stimuli. Non-living things do not carry out these processes.

  Plants and animals are living because they grow, need energy, and reproduce. Rocks and water are non-living because they do not grow or reproduce.

  Scientists use the life processes to classify things in the environment.
- Key Concepts:
  - Life processes
  - Living organisms
  - Non-living matter
- Worked Example:
  A seed grows into a plant and makes new seeds. This shows growth and reproduction, so it is living.
- Quick Check:
  - Name two life processes.
  - Is a cloud living or non-living? Why?
- Summary:
  Living things show life processes; non-living things do not.

### Lesson 5
- Grade: 4
- Subject: Social Sciences
- Term: 1
- Topic: Map Skills
- Lesson Title: Using a Simple Map Key
- Lesson Content:
  A map key explains the symbols used on a map. Symbols stand for real features like roads, rivers, and schools.

  When you read a map, first check the key to understand what each symbol means. This helps you find places accurately.

  The key makes the map clear and easy to use.
- Key Concepts:
  - Map key
  - Symbols
  - Map reading
- Worked Example:
  If the key shows a blue line for a river, then every blue line on the map is a river.
- Quick Check:
  - What is the purpose of a map key?
  - Why do maps use symbols?
- Summary:
  A map key explains symbols so you can read the map correctly.
