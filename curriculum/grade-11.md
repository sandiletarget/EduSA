### Lesson 1
- Grade: 11
- Subject: Home Language
- Term: 1
- Topic: Literature
- Lesson Title: Writing a Literary Essay
- Lesson Content:
  A literary essay analyses characters, themes, and techniques in a prescribed text. It uses evidence from the text to support ideas.

  Begin with a clear argument and organise paragraphs around key points. Each paragraph should include a quotation and explanation.

  Formal language and a logical structure are essential for a strong essay.
- Key Concepts:
  - Argument
  - Evidence
  - Literary analysis
- Worked Example:
  A paragraph about a character’s growth includes a quotation and explains how it shows change.
- Quick Check:
  - Why are quotations important in a literary essay?
  - What should a topic sentence do?
- Summary:
  Literary essays use evidence and analysis to support a clear argument.

### Lesson 2
- Grade: 11
- Subject: First Additional Language
- Term: 1
- Topic: Transactional Writing
- Lesson Title: Writing a Formal Report
- Lesson Content:
  A formal report presents information in a clear structure with headings. It uses objective language and facts rather than opinions.

  Typical sections include introduction, findings, and recommendations. Bullet points and numbered lists improve clarity.

  Reports are used to inform decision-making.
- Key Concepts:
  - Objective tone
  - Headings
  - Findings
- Worked Example:
  A report on school recycling includes data on waste collected and suggests improvements.
- Quick Check:
  - What language style is used in reports?
  - Name two sections of a report.
- Summary:
  Reports present factual information using clear headings and structure.

### Lesson 3
- Grade: 11
- Subject: Mathematics
- Term: 1
- Topic: Trigonometry
- Lesson Title: Using the Trigonometric Ratios
- Lesson Content:
  Trigonometric ratios relate angles to side lengths in right-angled triangles. The basic ratios are $\sin\theta$, $\cos\theta$, and $\tan\theta$.

  Use $\sin\theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$, $\cos\theta = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$, and $\tan\theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$.

  These ratios help find unknown sides or angles.
- Key Concepts:
  - Opposite and adjacent sides
  - Hypotenuse
  - Trigonometric ratios
- Worked Example:
  In a triangle with opposite = 6 and adjacent = 8:
  1) $\tan\theta = 6/8 = 0.75$.
  2) $\theta = \tan^{-1}(0.75)$.
- Quick Check:
  - Write the formula for $\cos\theta$.
  - If $\sin\theta = 0.5$, what can you say about the angle?
- Summary:
  Trigonometric ratios link angles and sides in right-angled triangles.

### Lesson 4
- Grade: 11
- Subject: Life Orientation
- Term: 1
- Topic: Career Guidance
- Lesson Title: Building a Career Pathway
- Lesson Content:
  A career pathway links subjects, skills, and qualifications to a long-term goal. It includes short-term steps such as completing Grade 12 and applying to institutions.

  Research is essential to understand entrance requirements and possible career options. Reflection on interests and strengths guides choices.

  A clear pathway supports focused decision-making.
- Key Concepts:
  - Pathway
  - Requirements
  - Planning
- Worked Example:
  A pathway to engineering includes Mathematics and Physical Sciences, then a university engineering program.
- Quick Check:
  - What information should you research for a career?
  - How do subjects link to career goals?
- Summary:
  Career pathways connect present choices to future qualifications and jobs.

### Lesson 5
- Grade: 11
- Subject: Physical Sciences
- Term: 1
- Topic: Newton’s Laws
- Lesson Title: Applying Newton’s Second Law
- Lesson Content:
  Newton’s Second Law states that the net force on an object equals mass times acceleration: $F_{net} = ma$.

  This means a larger force causes greater acceleration, and a larger mass needs more force for the same acceleration.

  The law is used to analyse motion in everyday situations and experiments.
- Key Concepts:
  - Net force
  - Mass
  - Acceleration
- Worked Example:
  A 5 kg cart accelerates at $2\,m/s^2$.
  1) $F_{net} = ma = 5 \times 2 = 10\,N$.
- Quick Check:
  - Calculate $F_{net}$ for $m=3\,kg$ and $a=4\,m/s^2$.
  - What happens to acceleration if mass increases and force stays constant?
- Summary:
  Newton’s Second Law links force, mass, and acceleration with $F=ma$.

### Lesson 6
- Grade: 11
- Subject: Life Sciences
- Term: 1
- Topic: Genetics
- Lesson Title: Monohybrid Crosses
- Lesson Content:
  Genes control inherited traits and are found on chromosomes. Each trait has alleles that may be dominant or recessive.

  A monohybrid cross examines one trait. A Punnett square predicts possible offspring genotypes and phenotypes.

  Understanding inheritance helps explain patterns in families and populations.
- Key Concepts:
  - Alleles
  - Dominant and recessive
  - Punnett square
- Worked Example:
  Cross $Tt \times Tt$ for tall (T) and short (t):
  Genotypes: 1 TT, 2 Tt, 1 tt. Phenotypes: 3 tall, 1 short.
- Quick Check:
  - What does a Punnett square show?
  - What is the phenotype ratio for $Tt \times Tt$?
- Summary:
  Monohybrid crosses use Punnett squares to predict inheritance of one trait.
