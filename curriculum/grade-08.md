### Lesson 1
- Grade: 8
- Subject: Home Language
- Term: 1
- Topic: Poetry
- Lesson Title: Understanding Imagery
- Lesson Content:
  Imagery uses words to create pictures in the reader’s mind. It often appeals to the senses such as sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch.

  Poets use imagery to make feelings and ideas more vivid. Look for descriptive words and comparisons that suggest sensory details.

  Identifying imagery helps you interpret the deeper meaning of a poem.
- Key Concepts:
  - Imagery
  - Sensory language
  - Interpretation
- Worked Example:
  “The sky was a purple blanket” creates a visual image of colour and covering.
- Quick Check:
  - Name two senses used in imagery.
  - Find one image in a short poem you know.
- Summary:
  Imagery uses sensory language to make poems vivid and meaningful.

### Lesson 2
- Grade: 8
- Subject: First Additional Language
- Term: 1
- Topic: Writing
- Lesson Title: Writing a Formal Paragraph
- Lesson Content:
  A formal paragraph has a clear topic sentence, supporting details, and a concluding sentence. It uses correct grammar and avoids slang.

  Each supporting sentence should explain or prove the main idea. Linking words like “therefore” or “however” make the paragraph flow.

  A strong conclusion reminds the reader of the main point.
- Key Concepts:
  - Topic sentence
  - Supporting detail
  - Formal style
- Worked Example:
  Topic sentence: “Recycling reduces waste in landfills.” Details follow with reasons and examples.
- Quick Check:
  - What is the job of a topic sentence?
  - Name one linking word.
- Summary:
  Formal paragraphs use a clear structure and precise language.

### Lesson 3
- Grade: 8
- Subject: Mathematics
- Term: 1
- Topic: Algebraic Expressions
- Lesson Title: Simplifying Like Terms
- Lesson Content:
  Like terms have the same variable parts. For example, $3x$ and $5x$ are like terms, but $3x$ and $3y$ are not.

  You simplify by adding or subtracting the coefficients of like terms. This makes expressions easier to use in equations.

  Simplifying is a key step in solving algebra problems.
- Key Concepts:
  - Like terms
  - Coefficients
  - Simplifying
- Worked Example:
  Simplify: $4a + 3a - 2a$.
  1) Add coefficients: $4 + 3 - 2 = 5$.
  2) Answer: $5a$.
- Quick Check:
  - Simplify: $7x - 2x + x$.
  - Are $3m$ and $3m^2$ like terms?
- Summary:
  Combine like terms by adding or subtracting their coefficients.

### Lesson 4
- Grade: 8
- Subject: Natural Sciences
- Term: 1
- Topic: Photosynthesis
- Lesson Title: The Photosynthesis Equation
- Lesson Content:
  Photosynthesis is the process where green plants make glucose using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. Chlorophyll in leaves captures light energy.

  The word equation is: carbon dioxide + water → glucose + oxygen. In symbols: $6CO_2 + 6H_2O \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2$.

  This process provides food for the plant and releases oxygen for other living things.
- Key Concepts:
  - Photosynthesis
  - Chlorophyll
  - Chemical equation
- Worked Example:
  Identify products in the equation: glucose and oxygen are the products because they appear on the right side.
- Quick Check:
  - What gas is released during photosynthesis?
  - Where does the energy come from?
- Summary:
  Photosynthesis uses sunlight to produce glucose and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water.

### Lesson 5
- Grade: 8
- Subject: Social Sciences
- Term: 1
- Topic: History
- Lesson Title: Causes of the Industrial Revolution
- Lesson Content:
  The Industrial Revolution began in Britain when machines replaced much manual work. New inventions like the steam engine increased production.

  Factors included access to coal and iron, improved transport, and investment in factories.

  These changes reshaped societies by moving people from farms to cities.
- Key Concepts:
  - Industrial Revolution
  - Invention
  - Urbanisation
- Worked Example:
  Steam engines powered factories, allowing goods to be produced faster than by hand.
- Quick Check:
  - Name one invention that drove the Industrial Revolution.
  - Why did people move to cities?
- Summary:
  New machines, resources, and investment caused the Industrial Revolution.

### Lesson 6
- Grade: 8
- Subject: Technology
- Term: 1
- Topic: Processing
- Lesson Title: Processing Materials Safely
- Lesson Content:
  Processing changes materials into useful products. Cutting, heating, and moulding are common processes.

  Safety is important because tools and heat can cause injuries. Personal protective equipment like gloves and goggles reduces risk.

  Following safety procedures protects you and improves product quality.
- Key Concepts:
  - Processing
  - Safety procedures
  - Protective equipment
- Worked Example:
  When heating plastic, use heat-resistant gloves and keep flammable materials away.
- Quick Check:
  - Give one example of processing.
  - Name one safety rule for using tools.
- Summary:
  Processing transforms materials and requires careful safety practices.

### Lesson 7
- Grade: 8
- Subject: Economic and Management Sciences
- Term: 1
- Topic: Entrepreneurship
- Lesson Title: Needs, Wants, and Business Opportunities
- Lesson Content:
  Needs are essentials like food and shelter. Wants are extras like new gadgets. Businesses often grow by meeting needs or popular wants.

  An opportunity exists when people need a product or service that is not easily available.

  Entrepreneurs identify opportunities by observing problems in the community.
- Key Concepts:
  - Needs and wants
  - Opportunity
  - Entrepreneurship
- Worked Example:
  If a community lacks a nearby fruit stall, selling fresh fruit is a business opportunity.
- Quick Check:
  - What is the difference between a need and a want?
  - Give one example of a business opportunity.
- Summary:
  Entrepreneurs find opportunities by meeting needs and popular wants.

### Lesson 8
