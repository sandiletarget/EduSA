### Lesson 1
- Grade: 9
- Subject: Home Language
- Term: 1
- Topic: Writing
- Lesson Title: Writing an Argumentative Paragraph
- Lesson Content:
  An argumentative paragraph presents a clear opinion and supports it with reasons. It aims to convince the reader using facts and logical points.

  Start with a topic sentence that states your position. Then give two or three reasons and evidence.

  A strong conclusion restates the opinion and links back to the reasons.
- Key Concepts:
  - Opinion
  - Evidence
  - Persuasion
- Worked Example:
  Topic sentence: “School uniforms should be worn.” Reasons include safety and equality.
- Quick Check:
  - What is the purpose of evidence?
  - Write a topic sentence for an argument about recycling.
- Summary:
  Argumentative writing states an opinion and supports it with reasons and evidence.

### Lesson 2
- Grade: 9
- Subject: First Additional Language
- Term: 1
- Topic: Comprehension
- Lesson Title: Identifying Bias and Fact
- Lesson Content:
  A fact can be proven true or false. An opinion shows personal feelings or beliefs.

  Bias appears when a text uses language that favours one side without balance. Look for strong adjectives and one-sided arguments.

  Identifying bias helps you read critically.
- Key Concepts:
  - Fact
  - Opinion
  - Bias
- Worked Example:
  “The plan is the best ever” is opinion because “best” is a judgment.
- Quick Check:
  - Is “Water boils at 100°C” a fact or opinion?
  - Name one word that could show bias.
- Summary:
  Facts are proven, opinions are beliefs, and bias shows one-sided language.

### Lesson 3
- Grade: 9
- Subject: Mathematics
- Term: 1
- Topic: Linear Equations
- Lesson Title: Solving for the Unknown
- Lesson Content:
  A linear equation has a variable with power 1, such as $2x + 5 = 17$. The goal is to isolate the variable.

  Use inverse operations: subtract, add, divide, or multiply on both sides equally.

  Checking your answer by substitution confirms accuracy.
- Key Concepts:
  - Linear equation
  - Inverse operations
  - Substitution check
- Worked Example:
  Solve $3x - 4 = 11$.
  1) Add 4: $3x = 15$.
  2) Divide by 3: $x = 5$.
  3) Check: $3(5) - 4 = 11$.
- Quick Check:
  - Solve $2x + 7 = 19$.
  - What does it mean to isolate the variable?
- Summary:
  Solve linear equations by using inverse operations on both sides.

### Lesson 4
- Grade: 9
- Subject: Natural Sciences
- Term: 1
- Topic: Electricity
- Lesson Title: Ohm’s Law
- Lesson Content:
  Ohm’s Law links voltage, current, and resistance in a circuit. The formula is $V = IR$.

  Voltage (V) is the push for electrons, current (I) is the flow, and resistance (R) opposes the flow.

  Using the formula helps you calculate unknown values in circuits.
- Key Concepts:
  - Voltage
  - Current
  - Resistance
- Worked Example:
  If $I = 2$ A and $R = 5$ Ω, then $V = IR = 2 \times 5 = 10$ V.
- Quick Check:
  - Calculate I when V = 12 V and R = 4 Ω.
  - What does resistance do in a circuit?
- Summary:
  Ohm’s Law uses $V = IR$ to relate voltage, current, and resistance.

### Lesson 5
- Grade: 9
- Subject: Social Sciences
- Term: 1
- Topic: Geography
- Lesson Title: Climate Change Causes
- Lesson Content:
  Climate change is the long-term increase in average global temperatures. It is mainly caused by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide.

  Burning fossil fuels and deforestation increase greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This traps heat and changes weather patterns.

  Understanding causes helps you evaluate solutions like energy efficiency and reforestation.
- Key Concepts:
  - Greenhouse gases
  - Fossil fuels
  - Deforestation
- Worked Example:
  Using coal for electricity releases carbon dioxide, which increases the greenhouse effect.
- Quick Check:
  - Name one greenhouse gas.
  - How does deforestation affect climate change?
- Summary:
  Human activities increase greenhouse gases and drive climate change.

### Lesson 6
- Grade: 9
- Subject: Technology
- Term: 1
- Topic: Systems and Control
- Lesson Title: Input, Process, Output, and Feedback
- Lesson Content:
  Systems use inputs, processes, and outputs. Input is what goes into the system, processing is what happens inside, and output is the result.

  Feedback is information that helps adjust the system to improve results. Many devices use sensors to provide feedback.

  Understanding systems helps you design effective solutions.
- Key Concepts:
  - Input
  - Process
  - Output
- Worked Example:
  A thermostat senses temperature (input), controls heating (process), and maintains room temperature (output) using feedback.
- Quick Check:
  - Identify the input and output in a toaster.
  - What is feedback used for?
- Summary:
  Systems use input, process, and output, with feedback to improve control.

### Lesson 7
- Grade: 9
- Subject: Economic and Management Sciences
- Term: 1
- Topic: Financial Literacy
- Lesson Title: Simple Interest
- Lesson Content:
  Simple interest is calculated on the original amount of money (principal). The formula is $I = P \times r \times t$.

  $P$ is the principal, $r$ is the interest rate per year, and $t$ is time in years.

  This helps you estimate the cost of borrowing or the growth of savings.
- Key Concepts:
  - Principal
  - Interest rate
  - Time
- Worked Example:
  If $P = R1\,000$, $r = 10\%$ per year, and $t = 2$ years:
  $I = 1\,000 \times 0.10 \times 2 = R200$.
- Quick Check:
  - Calculate interest on R500 at 8% for 3 years.
  - What does $P$ represent?
- Summary:
  Simple interest uses $I = P r t$ to find interest on the principal.

### Lesson 8
- Grade: 9
- Subject: Life Orientation
- Term: 1
- Topic: Career Development
- Lesson Title: Linking Subjects to Careers
- Lesson Content:
  School subjects build skills needed for careers. For example, Mathematics supports engineering and finance, while Life Sciences supports health careers.

  Career planning starts with understanding your strengths and interests. Research helps you see which subjects are required.

  Clear goals help you choose subjects that support future plans.
- Key Concepts:
  - Career planning
  - Skills
  - Subject choices
- Worked Example:
  A learner interested in medicine should prioritise Life Sciences and Mathematics.
- Quick Check:
  - How can subjects influence career choices?
  - Name one career linked to Geography.
- Summary:
  Subject choices build the skills needed for specific careers.

### Lesson 9
- Grade: 9
- Subject: Creative Arts
- Term: 1
- Topic: Drama
- Lesson Title: Elements of Drama
- Lesson Content:
  Drama uses elements such as plot, character, dialogue, and setting. These elements work together to tell a story on stage.

  Dialogue shows how characters think and feel. The setting shows where and when the action happens.

  Understanding the elements helps you create and analyse performances.
- Key Concepts:
  - Plot
  - Dialogue
  - Setting
- Worked Example:
  A script scene with two characters arguing uses dialogue to show conflict.
- Quick Check:
  - Name two elements of drama.
  - What does setting tell the audience?
- Summary:
  Drama elements like plot, dialogue, and setting shape a performance.
