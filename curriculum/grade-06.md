### Lesson 1
- Grade: 6
- Subject: Home Language
- Term: 1
- Topic: Summarising
- Lesson Title: Writing a Clear Summary
- Lesson Content:
  A summary is a short version of a longer text. It includes the main ideas but leaves out extra details.

  To summarise, read the text carefully, underline key points, and then write them in your own words.

  A good summary is brief, accurate, and easy to understand.
- Key Concepts:
  - Main ideas
  - Own words
  - Brevity
- Worked Example:
  Long text about water scarcity becomes: “Water is limited, so people must use it carefully and protect sources.”
- Quick Check:
  - What should be removed in a summary?
  - Why should you use your own words?
- Summary:
  Summaries capture the main ideas in fewer words.

### Lesson 2
- Grade: 6
- Subject: First Additional Language
- Term: 1
- Topic: Reading Fluency
- Lesson Title: Reading with Accuracy and Expression
- Lesson Content:
  Reading fluency means reading accurately, at a steady pace, and with expression. Fluent reading helps you understand the meaning.

  You can improve by practising short passages and focusing on punctuation. Pauses at commas and full stops make reading clearer.

  Expression shows feeling and makes the text interesting to listen to.
- Key Concepts:
  - Accuracy
  - Pace
  - Expression
- Worked Example:
  The sentence “Stop!” should be read with a strong voice to show urgency.
- Quick Check:
  - What three parts make reading fluent?
  - Why is punctuation important when reading aloud?
- Summary:
  Fluency combines accuracy, pace, and expression.

### Lesson 3
- Grade: 6
- Subject: Mathematics
- Term: 1
- Topic: Integers and Number Patterns
- Lesson Title: Finding the Rule in a Pattern
- Lesson Content:
  Number patterns follow a rule. The rule tells how to get from one number to the next.

  Patterns can increase, decrease, or use multiplication and division. Finding the rule helps you predict missing numbers.

  Write the rule in words or as a simple statement such as “add 3.”
- Key Concepts:
  - Number pattern
  - Rule
  - Predicting
- Worked Example:
  Pattern: 4, 7, 10, 13, __
  Rule: add 3. Next number is 16.
- Quick Check:
  - Find the next number: 20, 15, 10, __
  - What is the rule for 2, 4, 8, 16?
- Summary:
  Number patterns follow a rule that you can use to find missing terms.

### Lesson 4
- Grade: 6
- Subject: Natural Sciences and Technology
- Term: 1
- Topic: Electricity
- Lesson Title: Series Circuits
- Lesson Content:
  A series circuit is a closed loop where electric current flows through one path. If the path breaks, the whole circuit stops working.

  Components in a circuit include a cell, wires, a switch, and a bulb. The switch opens or closes the circuit.

  Understanding series circuits helps you build simple electrical systems safely.
- Key Concepts:
  - Electric current
  - Circuit components
  - Series circuit
- Worked Example:
  When the switch is closed, the bulb lights. When the switch is open, the bulb goes off because the circuit is broken.
- Quick Check:
  - What happens if a wire breaks in a series circuit?
  - Name two circuit components.
- Summary:
  Series circuits have one path for current, so a break stops the whole circuit.

### Lesson 5
- Grade: 6
- Subject: Social Sciences
- Term: 1
- Topic: Climate and Weather
- Lesson Title: Factors that Affect Climate
- Lesson Content:
  Climate is the long-term pattern of weather in a place. It is affected by latitude, altitude, and distance from the sea.

  Places near the equator are warmer because they receive more direct sunlight. High places are cooler due to thinner air.

  Coastal areas have milder temperatures because the sea warms and cools slowly.
- Key Concepts:
  - Climate
  - Latitude
  - Altitude
- Worked Example:
  A town on a mountain is cooler than a town at sea level, even if both are in the same region.
- Quick Check:
  - How does altitude affect temperature?
  - Why are coastal areas less extreme in temperature?
- Summary:
  Climate depends on location, height, and distance from the sea.

### Lesson 6
- Grade: 6
- Subject: Life Skills
- Term: 1
- Topic: Personal Well-being
- Lesson Title: Goal Setting and Time Management
- Lesson Content:
  Goals are targets you want to achieve. A good goal is specific and has a time frame.

  Time management helps you plan tasks and avoid rushing. Using a simple timetable shows what to do and when to do it.

  Small daily steps make long-term goals easier to reach.
- Key Concepts:
  - Goals
  - Planning
  - Timetable
- Worked Example:
  Goal: Read one chapter every evening for two weeks.
- Quick Check:
  - What makes a goal clear?
  - How can a timetable help you?
- Summary:
  Clear goals and planning help you use time wisely.
